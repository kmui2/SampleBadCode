In this task you will see schematic pictures of various rockets.  There are
two types of rockets - gek rockets, and talp rockets. Your goal is to figure
out which ones are which. On each trial of this experiment you will see a picture
of one of the rockets and a prompt 'Is this a gek rocket' or 'Is this a talp
rocket'. You should respond 'Yes' or 'No' depending on what you think the
answer is. Press the left key to respond 'Yes' and the right key to respond
'No'. The experimenter will let you know which specific buttons to use. After
you make a choice you will hear a buzzing sound if you made a mistake, and a
bleeping sound if you responded correctly. In the beginning you will just be
guessing, but you'll soon find yourself improving. **Note that on some trials
there won't be any feedback (buzz or bleep) sounds. This is normal.**
