In this task you will see schematic pictures of various rockets.  There are
two types of rockets: gek rockets, and talp rockets. Your goal is to figure out
which ones are which by testing hypotheses. On each trial of this experiment you
will see a picture of one of the rockets and then the two options (gek and talp)
will appear to the left and right of the picture. You should respond with the
appropriate (left or right) key to choose the kind of rocket you think it is.
After you make a choice you will hear a buzzing sound if you made a mistake,
and a bleeping sound if you responded correctly. In the beginning you will just
be guessing, but you'll soon find yourself improving. On each trial you should
ask yourself questions like "is it the shape of the wings? Is it the shape
of the tail? YOU WILL NEED TO CONSIDER MORE THAN ONE FEATURE AT A TIME". 
Note that on some trials there won't be any feedback (buzz or bleep) sounds.
This is normal
