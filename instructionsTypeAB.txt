In this task you will see schematic pictures of various rockets.  There are
two types of rockets - gek rockets, and talp rockets. Your goal is to figure out
which ones are which. On each trial of this experiment you will see a picture of
one of the rockets and then the two options (Type A and Type B) will appear to
the left and right of the picture. You should respond with the appropriate (left or right)
key to choose the kind of rocket you think it is (Type A or Type B). After you make a
choice you will hear a buzzing sound if you made a mistake, and a bleeping sound if
you responded correctly. In the beginning you will just be guessing, but you'll soon
find yourself improving. *Note that on some trials there won't be any feedback
(buzz or bleep) sounds. This is normal.*
