In this task you will see schematic pictures of various rockets.
There are two types of rockets - gek rockets, and talp rockets. Your goal
is to figure out which ones are which. On each trial of this experiment you will
see a picture of one of the rockets and then the two options (gek and talp) will appear
to the left and right of the picture. You should respond with the appropriate (left or right)
key to choose the kind of rocket you think it is. After you make a choice you will
hear a buzzing sound if you made a mistake, and a bleeping sound if you responded
correctly. In the beginning you will just be guessing, but you'll soon find yourself
improving. Note that on some trials there won't be any feedback (buzz or bleep) sounds.
This is normal.

Try to do your best, and don't spend too much time on any one trial. Please let the
experimenter know if you have any questions. We'll start with some practice trials.
